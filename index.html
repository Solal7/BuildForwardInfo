              I am Solal Chasques, a 17-year-old high school student passionate about engineering, the environment, and sustainability. I launched the BUILD FORWARD project — a hands-on initiative that combines technological innovation, environmental impact, and community engagement. The project consists of designing and producing real urban furniture (benches, tables, seats) using recycled ocean plastics and marine sediments transformed through sustainable engineering processes.

Each piece is conceived not only as functional infrastructure, but as a tool for raising awareness about ocean health, circular economy solutions, and sustainable design.

          </h2>
          <div className="prose prose-lg max-w-none text-foreground">
            <p className="leading-relaxed">
              The project was born from my personal environmental commitment, following the documentary "Earth Protectors", and my discovery of Plastic Odyssey, a pioneering initiative that deploys local plastic recycling technologies aboard a global expedition vessel. I have since engaged directly with the City of Hossegor (on the Atlantic coast of France), which has formally expressed interest in hosting the first prototypes in local parks and schools. This makes Hossegor a flagship partner in demonstrating how civic spaces can reflect marine resilience.

            <p className="leading-relaxed">
              The Build Forward project employs a sustainable engineering approach to transform marine pollutants into durable, functional urban furniture. Here's how we do it:
            </p>
            
            <div>
              <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-accent mb-2">Collection of Ocean Plastics</h3>
              <p className="leading-relaxed">
                We partner with coastal communities and organizations like Plastic Odyssey to collect plastic waste from oceans and shorelines. This prevents further marine pollution and provides the raw material for our furniture.
              </p>
            </div>

            <div>
              <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-accent mb-2">Processing Marine Sediments</h3>
              <p className="leading-relaxed">
                In collaboration with Gwilen, we utilize mineral-based materials derived from marine sediments. These sustainable alternatives to traditional concrete components reduce the environmental footprint of our products.
              </p>
            </div>

            <div>
              <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-accent mb-2">Cleaning and Sorting</h3>
              <p className="leading-relaxed">
                Collected plastics are thoroughly cleaned and sorted by polymer type. This ensures quality control and optimal processing conditions for the recycling phase.
              </p>
            </div>

            <div>
              <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-accent mb-2">Shredding and Processing</h3>
              <p className="leading-relaxed">
                The cleaned plastics are shredded into small flakes, which are then processed into a consistent material format suitable for manufacturing. Marine sediments are similarly prepared for integration.
              </p>
            </div>

            <div>
              <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-accent mb-2">Manufacturing and Molding</h3>
              <p className="leading-relaxed">
                Using sustainable engineering techniques, we combine recycled plastics and marine-based minerals to create composite materials. These are then molded into furniture designs using energy-efficient processes.
              </p>
            </div>

            <div>
              <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-accent mb-2">Quality Testing and Finishing</h3>
              <p className="leading-relaxed">
                Each furniture piece undergoes rigorous testing for durability, safety, and weather resistance. Final finishing ensures both aesthetic appeal and functionality for public spaces.
              </p>
            </div>

            <div>
              <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-accent mb-2">Installation and Awareness</h3>
              <p className="leading-relaxed">
                Furniture is installed in public spaces like parks and schools. Each piece carries an informative label explaining its materials and origins, serving as an educational tool about ocean health and circular economy.
